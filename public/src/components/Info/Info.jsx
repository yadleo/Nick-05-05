							Hi! My name is Nicholas Lai and I am a motion graphic designer
							that graduated from Art Center College of Design. I love to create
							motion pieces that draw the viewer into a different mood or world.
							Through my travels around the world, I have learned how to
							communicate with all different kinds of people and in different
							languages, ones that I speak and also ones that I donâ€™t. With
							this, I take great joy in connecting and solving problems with
							different groups of people.
