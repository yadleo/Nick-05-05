						Hi! I am a motion graphic designer that graduated from Art Center
						College of Design. I love to create motion pieces that draw the
						viewer into a different mood or world. Through my travels around the
						world, I have learned how to communicate with all different kinds of
						people and in different languages, ones that I speak and also ones
						that I donâ€™t. With this, I take great joy in connecting and solving
						problems with different groups of people.
